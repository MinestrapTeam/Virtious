A dimensional mod for #Modjam 2013

Basic Info
==========
You can teleport to the dimension by creating a 3x3 platform of Iron Blocks, placing a Fuel Block (crafted with a Coal Block with two Glass on the sides, Iron Blocks in the corners, Redstone Dust on top and a Diamond on the bottom.) on top of the platform, and then right-clicking the Fuel Block with a Blaze Powder. The Fuel Block will then transform into a Portal which can be used to travel to the dimension.

The mod features a new dimension full of ores, biomes, and various other content. I won't make a full wiki of it here, but play around with the creative menus to look through all the content!

How to Compile
==============
Download forge src (we use 804), install it and then place the teamm folder to forgefolder/mcp/src/minecraft

1. Then recompile with the recompile.bat in mcp
2. deobfuscate.bat
3. zip the classes in reobf folder
4. place the assets folder next to the teamm folder in the zip.
5. Enjoy!
